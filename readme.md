# Random File Opener

An old *Java* based application, bult during my early years of Java development.

My second pet project.

Archived via GitHub and retrace my roots.

# How to use

Run it and select a directory via the UI.
Select a source directory and identify all subfolders and files within them.
Based on extension types, open a single random file.

# Uses

Cannot think what game to play? What music to hear? What Video to watch?
Scan your library and open up a random item within it.

# Good old times

First some time in 2014.
Wow, I'm old.
